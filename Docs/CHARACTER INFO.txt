CHARACTER INFO

Each character should have its own directory with subfolders:
/ArtAssets/: Contains sprites, animations, and sounds.
/Settings/: Includes the character's settings file.
/AI/: Contains the AI behavior file.

Art Assets:
Use PNG or TGA format for sprites because of their transparency support.
Each animation should be broken into individual frames, with the settings file referencing specific frames for specific moves.
2.2 Settings File:
Use a JSON format for flexibility:

json:
{
    "name": "CharacterName",
    "health": 100,
    "speed": 5,
    "animations": {
        "walk": {
            "frames": ["walk1.png", "walk2.png", ...],
            "fps": 10
        },
        "attack": {
            "frames": ["attack1.png", ...],
            "fps": 12,
            "damage": 10,
            "hitbox": {...}  // Define hitbox properties here
        },
        ...
    }
}
